# A LaTeX Cookbook

Contains a lot of things I referred to when doing my graduate program. A _lot_ of these recipes come from [this excellent MathOverflow post](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference). I've added a few things I've found myself. Contributions are welcome

## Some Notes

This project uses [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/). This means that we get "math-mode" rendering and not "text-mode" rendering (for things like tables, for example).

This means that you cannot just use your favorite LaTeX package here. That being said, here are [some packages/extensions that MathJax itself supports](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/index.html). You'll find common things like `color` and `mathbb` on there.
