# A LaTeX Cookbook

Contains a lot of things I referred to when doing my graduate program. A _lot_ of these recipes come from [this excellent MathOverflow post](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference). I've added a few things I've found myself. Contributions are welcome
